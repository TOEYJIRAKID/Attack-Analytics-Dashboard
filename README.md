## üöÄ **Project Name** :

PoD Attack Analytics ‚Äì Ping of Death Attack Analytics Dashboard

## üìå **Project Overview** :

Ping of Death Attack Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool that visualizes and tracks Ping of Death (PoD) attacks on your network. This dashboard provides in-depth analysis and real-time insights into the nature of these attacks, helping you to stay ahead of malicious activities and protect your infrastructure.

## üéØ **Objective** :

- Develop a monitoring system for detecting and analyzing Ping of Death (PoD) attacks.  
- Provide a real-time dashboard for visualizing attack patterns and network anomalies.  
- Enhance cybersecurity awareness and response by logging PoD attacks efficiently.  
- Implement a structured database for storing attack details and historical trends.  

## ‚ú® **Key Features** :

- **Real-Time Attack Detection** ‚Äì Instantly detect and log Ping of Death (PoD) attacks on the network.
- **Interactive Dashboard** ‚Äì Visualize attack trends, sources, and frequency with graphical charts.
- **IP & Port Tracking** ‚Äì Monitor attack origins, destination IPs, and port numbers in real-time.

## üõ† **Ping of Death Attack Command** :

To simulate a Ping of Death attack and test your system's detection capabilities, use the following command:

```bash
sudo hping3 --icmp --flood --spoof <spoofed_ip> <target_ip>
```
This command floods the target with malformed ICMP packets, mimicking a Ping of Death attack, allowing you to test how well your system can detect and log the attack.

## üèõÔ∏è **Database Structure** :

The system logs key attack parameters to help security teams analyze attack trends:

|  #  | Attribute        | Description                               | Data Type |
|----|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1  | `src`         | Source IP of the attack                   | String    |
| 2  | `dst`         | Destination IP of the attack              | String    |
| 3  | `proto`       | Protocol used (ICMP)                      | String    |
| 4  | `attack_type` | Type of attack (Ping of Death)            | String    |
| 5  | `timestamp`   | Time when attack was detected             | String    |
| 6  | `ttl`         | Time-to-Live (TTL) value in the packet    | Integer   |
| 7  | `mac_src`     | MAC address of the attack source          | String    |
| 8  | `mac_dst`     | MAC address of the destination            | String    |
